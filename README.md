# User Handler

## Description
The user handler is responsible for handling user information sent to it by the user interface component. The information will either be saved to the database creating a new user, used for authentication of the user by matching provided data with data saved in the database, or used to verify the users email address.

## Component Responsibilities
* Save user data in the database

* Authentication of users 

* Verification of usersâ€™ email address

* Listen to MQTT for user data requests from the user interface component

* Publish user data via MQTT

## Architectural style
- **Publish and subscribe:**

The user handler acts as a subscriber when receiving the user requests from the user interface component. It then either searches the database for the requested user and publishes the results to the MQTT Broker, or saves the data to the database.
